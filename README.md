# Arduino_flappybird

In this exciting Arduino project, we bring the classic Flappy Bird game to life using an ST7789 TFT display and a few buttons! 
What makes this video special? All the code was written by Grok 3, an AI assistant from xAI, and I’ll show you how it works step-by-step. 
Whether you’re a beginner or an experienced maker, this tutorial is perfect for learning game development on Arduino.
